Project Overview:
The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game developed in Python using the pygame library. The goal is to control the snake to eat food that randomly appears on the screen, while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake consumes food, it grows in length, and the player's score increases. The game ends when the snake collides with a boundary or itself.

Features:
Snake Growth: The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
Random Food Generation: The food appears at random locations within the game window.
Score Tracking: The player's score is displayed based on how much food the snake has consumed.
Game Over Prompt: After losing, the player can choose to restart the game or exit.
